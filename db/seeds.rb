  description: "Ruthie is a shy but darling white 3 yeard old Chinese Crested powder puff being fostered in Tel Aviv. She had a rough start and was rescued from a large hoarding situation last year. She is learning to walk on a leash and play with toys and the other dogs in her foster home. She is so smart she has also learned sit and down! Ruthie's new family will need a fenced in yard, a pretty quiet home and a lot of time, patience and positive reinforcement to help Ruthie become the dog she is destined to be. Young children are too stressful for Ruthie as they move to quickly. Ruthie is pretty independent when it comes to other dogs, another well adjusted dog in the home may be helpful for transition and companionship but not mandatory.",
